# Booking-Website

Live Link: https://yasindunethmina.github.io/booking-website/ ðŸ˜Ž

I wanted to challenge myself with advanced CSS concepts in this project ðŸ”¥ so this is written in pure HTML and SCSS.

### Things I've mastered with this project:

-Advanced responsive design concepts (responsive images).

-Writing globally used SCSS @mixins with $breakpoints for media queries.

-Browser support concepts

-SCSS syntax, variables with selectors, operators, calculations, pseudo elements, perspective, color-gradient properties, clip-path, skew, filters and etc!

-CSS floats, grids, animations, transitions

-packaging files with a optimial way using autoprefixer and postcss-cli

## GUIDE TO USE THIS PROJECT FOR DEVELOPMENT:

1. You can clone this repo easily and implement new features or make your own new version ðŸ˜Š As I've been using SCSS-extended version of CSS on this project, first you need to install SCSS compiler into the project, anyway ``` npm install ``` will do everything you need! For more help if neeed, check this: https://sass-lang.com/install

2. Once you install all required dependancies, you can easily compile all the SCSS files with ``` npm  watch:sass ``` and it'll automatically start the website on a local-server.

3. I've done the project on clean folder structure and added comments for all strange looking places in the code, so it'd be easy for you to understand!

### HAPPY CODING!!!
