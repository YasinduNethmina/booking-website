I wanted to challenge myself with advanced CSS concepts in this project, so this is written in pure HTML and SCSS.
Things I've mastered with this project:

-Advanced responsive design concepts (responsive images).
-Writing globally used SCSS @mixins with $breakpoints for media queries.
-Browser support concepts
-SCSS syntax, using SCSS varlectors, pseudo elements, perspective, color-gradient properties, clip-path, skew, filters etc!


You can clone this repo easily and implement new features or make your own new version. As I've been using SCSS (SASS version) on this project first you need to install Sass compiler.
